# Development Workflow

## Daily Development Process

### 1. Task Analysis
- Read requirements thoroughly
- Identify dependencies and constraints
- Break down into smaller tasks
- Estimate effort and timeline

### 2. Code Implementation
- Follow applicable rules from rules directory
- Write clean, documented code
- Implement error handling
- Add necessary tests

### 3. Code Review Process
- Self-review code before submission
- Check against project standards
- Verify documentation updates
- Run all tests locally

### 4. Deployment Preparation
- Update version numbers
- Update CHANGELOG.md
- Verify environment configurations
- Prepare rollback plan

## Git Workflow

### Branch Strategy
```bash
# Feature development
git checkout -b feature/task-description
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
git push origin feature/task-description

# Bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
git commit -m "fix: resolve issue with component"
git push origin fix/bug-description

# Hotfixes
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-issue
git commit -m "hotfix: critical security patch"
git push origin hotfix/critical-issue
```

### Commit Message Format
```
type(scope): description

Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
Scope: component, module, or area affected
Description: brief summary in present tense
```
