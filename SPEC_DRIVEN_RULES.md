# Spec-Driven Development Rules

## Overview

Spec-Driven Development is a structured approach inspired by Specification by Example (SBE) methodology. This process guides users and AI through collaborative development using a waterfall-like model with AI asynchronous execution and user control, reducing rework and improving efficiency.

## When to Use This Framework

### ‚úÖ Ideal for:
- **Large projects** (2+ weeks development time)
- **Team collaboration** requiring formal documentation
- **Complex systems** with multiple integrations
- **Client projects** needing detailed specifications
- **MVP development** with planned iterations
- **Projects requiring formal approval processes**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider alternatives for:
- **Simple scripts** or single-file solutions
- **Rapid prototyping** without documentation needs
- **Emergency hotfixes** requiring immediate action
- **Personal projects** with flexible requirements

### üîÑ Relationship with Other Rules:
- **Extends GENERAL_RULES.md**: Builds upon the five key steps with formal documentation
- **Complements TASK_EXECUTION_RULES.md**: Uses structured documentation for complex task management
- **Integrates with AI_CODING_RULES.md**: Provides framework for multi-step AI planning

## Core Process Flow

### Phase 1: Requirements Collection
**Trigger**: User provides high-level prompt (e.g., "Develop an article comment system using Vue + TypeScript")

**AI Actions**:
1. Generate detailed requirements document (`requirements.md`)
2. Include user stories, feature points, and clarification questions
3. Present for user review and modification

**Output Structure**:
```markdown
# Requirements Document

## Project Overview
[High-level description]

## User Stories
- As a [user type], I want [functionality] so that [benefit]

## Functional Requirements
- [Detailed feature list]

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance, security, scalability requirements

## Clarification Questions
- [Questions for user to refine requirements]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [Testable conditions for completion]
```

### Phase 2: Design Documentation
**Trigger**: Requirements approved by user

**AI Actions**:
1. Analyze requirements and generate design specification (`design.md`)
2. Cover architecture, technical solutions, and potential risks
3. Support visualization output (logic diagrams, Markdown format)

**Output Structure**:
```markdown
# Design Document

## Architecture Overview
- System architecture diagram
- Component relationships
- Data flow

## Technical Stack
- Frontend: [Technology choices with rationale]
- Backend: [Technology choices with rationale]
- Database: [Database design]

## API Design
- Endpoint specifications
- Request/response formats
- Authentication strategy

## Risk Analysis
- Technical risks and mitigation strategies
- Performance considerations
- Security implications

## Implementation Strategy
- Development phases
- Integration points
- Testing approach
```

### Phase 3: Task Breakdown
**Trigger**: Design document approved by user

**AI Actions**:
1. Generate comprehensive task list (`tasks.md`)
2. Each task includes "Start Task" indicator
3. Support execution order selection, queue management, and modification

**Output Structure**:
```markdown
# Task List

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup
- [ ] **Task 1.1**: Initialize project structure
  - **Priority**: High
  - **Estimated Time**: 30 minutes
  - **Dependencies**: None
  - **Deliverables**: Project scaffolding, configuration files
  
- [ ] **Task 1.2**: Setup development environment
  - **Priority**: High
  - **Estimated Time**: 45 minutes
  - **Dependencies**: Task 1.1
  - **Deliverables**: Development server, build tools

### Phase 2: Backend Development
- [ ] **Task 2.1**: Database schema design
  - **Priority**: High
  - **Estimated Time**: 1 hour
  - **Dependencies**: Task 1.1
  - **Deliverables**: Database models, migrations

### Phase 3: Frontend Development
[Continue with detailed task breakdown]

## Task Execution Queue
1. [User-selected task order]
2. [Parallel execution opportunities]
3. [Critical path identification]
```

### Phase 4: Execution and Iteration
**Process**:
1. AI executes tasks step by step
2. User can intervene at any time
3. Requirement changes cascade to all phases
4. Support preview, rollback, and automation
5. Documents and code stored in `.spec` folder

## Implementation Guidelines

### Requirements Phase Best Practices
- **User Story Format**: Follow "As a [role], I want [feature] so that [benefit]" structure
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Use Given-When-Then format for testability
- **Clarification Questions**: Ask specific, actionable questions
- **Scope Definition**: Clearly define what's in and out of scope

### Design Phase Best Practices
- **Architecture Decisions**: Document rationale for technical choices
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify and plan mitigation for technical risks
- **API First**: Design APIs before implementation
- **Scalability Considerations**: Plan for future growth

### Task Breakdown Best Practices
- **Atomic Tasks**: Each task should be completable in 1-4 hours
- **Clear Dependencies**: Explicitly define task relationships
- **Deliverable Focus**: Each task should produce tangible output
- **Priority Classification**: High/Medium/Low priority assignment

### Execution Best Practices
- **Incremental Delivery**: Complete tasks produce working features
- **Continuous Integration**: Regular integration and testing
- **Documentation Updates**: Keep specs updated with implementation
- **User Feedback Loops**: Regular checkpoints for user validation
