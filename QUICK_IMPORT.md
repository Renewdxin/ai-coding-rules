# AI Coding Rules - Active

Follow these development rules for all coding tasks:

## Core Framework (Always Apply)
1. **Define Task Scope** â†’ 2. **Locate Changes** â†’ 3. **Minimal Code** â†’ 4. **Review** â†’ 5. **Document**

## Language Standards
- Code comments: English only
- User communication: Chinese (if user speaks Chinese)
- No emojis in code, keep comments brief

## Git Rules (MANDATORY)
- Ask user before `git add` (list files first)
- One-line commits only: `type(scope): description`
- Check username/email before first commit
- Branch naming: `feature/**` format required

## Content Control
- Never expand beyond user requirements
- Frontend: No mock data without permission
- Optimization: Never change existing functionality
- Always confirm changes with user

## Task Complexity Auto-Detection
- **Simple tasks**: Apply core rules only
- **Complex tasks**: Multi-step planning with user confirmation
- **Large projects**: Generate formal documentation (requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md)

## Code Quality
- SOLID principles, DRY, KISS, YAGNI
- Security-first (input validation, error handling)
- Files under 500 lines, descriptive naming
- Performance considerations
