# Testing Rules

## Test Strategy
- Write moderate amount of tests, avoid over-testing
- Focus on critical business logic
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Maintain test independence

## Test Organization
- Group related tests logically
- Use descriptive test names
- Keep tests simple and focused
- Avoid complex test setups

## Test Files Management
- Add all test files to .gitignore
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Organize tests by feature/module
- Clean up test artifacts

## Coverage Guidelines
- Aim for meaningful coverage, not 100%
- Focus on high-risk areas
- Test public interfaces thoroughly
- Don't test implementation details

## Test Data
- Use minimal test data sets
- Avoid hardcoded values where possible
- Clean up test data after runs
- Use factories for complex objects
